# E-commerce Back End

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to solidify my knowledge of object relational mapping. I was to build a terminal-based app using my knowledge of Javascript, SQL, Node, and Sequelize. Additionaly, this challenge introduced me to the concepts of controllers and Express routing. Understanding how to use insomnia, was crucial for completing this project without having to rely on a front end or having to define the payload within the app.
